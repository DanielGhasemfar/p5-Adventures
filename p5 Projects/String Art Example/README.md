### Introduction
This project has been a collaborative work to recreate the algorythm used by Petros Vrellis in his recreation of
El Greco's Jesus:

## Showcase
This is a showcase of how the program works with a relatively small amount of nails (80) with a picture of me.

## Notes
It is vital that you know that this program can cause overheating in some computers.
In this case, lower the number of nails used by the program, or press the "stop/continue" button
from time to time, to let your computer cool down again.

The program might be very slow for the first few nails. After some time it will gain speed.
